This is a bee origin datapack. The Origin mod (fabric) is required for this to work

POWERS:

+
Poisonous- inflicts poison to target for 2,5 seconds
Flowery- regenerates health and gets saturation near multiple flowers
Flight- basically toggle levitation (primary key)

-
Lifespan- 3 hearts less health
Rain- hunger, slowness and weakness in rain
Nighttime- hunger, slowness and weakness at night when not under cover

?
Death- insta-kills nearest person but also dies instantly (secondary key)
Slow-fall- falls slowly (mostly required for the flight power to work, but also fits the bee origin)
No food- can't eat any normal food, instead use the "flowery" power

Only add the second zip file in your datapacks folder

UPDATED ORIGIN: Evolved Bumblebee
I edited the bumblebee origin a bit and gave it more powers and more setbacks, so if you want to kind of "level up" your origins, then this is basically the "evolved" version of the bumblebee origin.

These are the edited and new powers:

Flight: The flight is slightly faster. Also, instead of the primary key, you use your jump key for levitation. That also means you can't normally jump anymore. 
Bloom: The saturation is slower, however, honey is now edible and it also gives speed 1 for 30 seconds and strength 1 for 10 seconds 
Poisonous: Same, but if another player attacks you, they have a 10% chance to get poisoned
NEW: Plants: You don't take damage from berry bushes and cacti, because you've learned to navigate these plants
NEW: Climbing: You can constantly climb like a bug 

Lifespan: no changes 
Water: instead of weakness, slowness and hunger, you now just get damage, like Enderian 
Nighttime: The weakness, slowness and hunger still exist, but only at night 
NEW: Flames: Fire does 1.75x more damage 
NEW: Too hot: Hot biomes give  mining fatigue 1 

Death: Insta-kills you and the closest player to you (secondary)
No food: You can't eat normal food, except for honey 
NEW: Smol: You're now 1 block tall 
NEW: Bees!: You can spawn in 5 bees (but do NOT hit them)(primary)

!!! Now requires Pehkui and Extra origins to work!
