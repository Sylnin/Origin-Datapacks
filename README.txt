This is a bee origin datapack. The Origin mod (fabric) is required for this to work

POWERS:

+
Poisonous- inflicts poison to target for 2,5 seconds
Flowery- regenerates health and gets saturation near multiple flowers
Flight- basically toggle levitation (primary key)

-
Lifespan- 3 hearts less health
Rain- hunger, slowness and weakness in rain

?
Death- insta-kills nearest person but also dies instantly (secondary key)
Slow-fall- falls slowly (mostly required for the flight power to work, but also fits the bee origin)
No food- can't eat any normal food, instead use the "flowery" power

Only add the second zip file in your datapacks folder

If there's any problems with the origin, use the issues tab, or DM me on Twitter @sakivsiil or on Reddit u/sakisiil
