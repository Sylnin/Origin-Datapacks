This is a bee origin datapack. The Origin mod (fabric) is required for this to work

POWERS:

+
Poisonous- inflicts poison to target for 2,5 seconds
Flowery- regenerates health and gets saturation near multiple flowers
Flight- basically toggle levitation (primary key)

-
Lifespan- 3 hearts less health
Rain- hunger, slowness and weakness in rain
Nighttime- hunger, slowness and weakness at night when not under cover

?
Death- insta-kills nearest person but also dies instantly (secondary key)
Slow-fall- falls slowly (mostly required for the flight power to work, but also fits the bee origin)
No food- can't eat any normal food, instead use the "flowery" power

Only add the second zip file in your datapacks folder

UPDATE! The second bee datapack file, beeupdate.zip, is an updated version of the origin. It was pretty op so i tried to make it better, the OP one is still there though. 
The updates for beeupdate.zip:

Saturation near flowers is now saturation 2 instead of 4 (btw you have to be at least near 9 flowers for it to work)
Poison is now Poison 3 for 1,5 seconds


I also added a raccoon origin datapack!

+
Speed and strength at night
Night vision
Extra inventory (drops after death)
Can climb
Can reach further
Immune to poison and hunger

-
Less health (-2 hearts)
Gets hungry faster
Weakness and slowness during day
Can't open trapdoors, doors and gates
Can only eat trash food (everything that gives 1 saturation + rotten flesh)
